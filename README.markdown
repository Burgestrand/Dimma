What is Dimma?
==============
Dimma is a Ruby library aimed to create a simple interface to [Beacons REST API](http://www.beaconpush.com/), built on top of the sweet [REST Client](http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client).

How do I use it?
----------------
Excellent question! Hereâ€™s how to show site visitors Kim is in da house!

    Dimma.new(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY).message 'Guys! Kim is here, act cool!'

Really? Yeah, really! For more advanced usage I suggest you [read the documentation](http://rdoc.info/projects/Burgestrand/Dimma).

Miscellaneous notes
-------------------
- Dimma uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) as of version v1.0.0!
